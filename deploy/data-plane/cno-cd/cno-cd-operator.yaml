                                    Un-prefixed names are reserved for IANA standard
                                    service names (as per RFC-6335 and http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names).
                                    Non-standard protocols should use prefixed names
                                    such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol. Field
                                    can be enabled with ServiceAppProtocol feature
                                    gate.

                                    This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports within a ServiceSpec
                                    must have unique names. When considering the endpoints
                                    for a Service, this must match the 'name' field
                                    in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort
                                    is defined on this service.
